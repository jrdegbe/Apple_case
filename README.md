## Apple Inc. Database Solution  ##

Overview
This document provides a comprehensive guide for setting up and managing a relational database for Apple Inc., covering entities identification, relationships definition, database schema design, normalization, and the use of Docker for PostgreSQL and PGAdmin setup.

Steps Overview
Step 1: Identify and Understand Entities
Entities like Customers, Apple Accounts, Mailshot Campaigns, Orders, and others are identified and described with attributes.

Step 2: Define Relationships
Relationships between entities are established based on business rules, such as a customer making orders and products associated with orders.

Step 3: Design Database Schema
Tables for each entity are created with primary and foreign keys, and attributes for each entity are defined.

Step 4: Normalize the Database
The database is organized into the Third Normal Form (3NF) to eliminate redundancies and ensure consistency.

Step 5: Create Tables
Tables are implemented in the database with appropriate data types for each attribute.

Step 6: Implement Relationships
Foreign key constraints are set up to enforce relationships and ensure referential integrity.

Step 7: Populate Sample Data
Sample data is inserted to test the database design, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

Step 8: Query Design
Queries are developed to extract information based on given scenarios using SQL.

Step 9: Scenario-based Queries
Specific queries are created for each provided scenario.

Step 10: Market Research Query
A query is designed to extract demographic information and preferences of customers who bought the iPhone 12 series.

Step 11: Returns Eligibility Query
A query is designed to identify customers eligible for returns based on the purchase date.

Step 12: Testing and Optimization
Queries are tested with sample data and optimized for performance.

Docker Setup for PostgreSQL and PGAdmin
Docker Images and Docker Compose
Understanding Docker images and Docker Compose is crucial for setting up and running the PostgreSQL and PGAdmin.

Docker Images
A Docker image is a template used as the base for creating a Container. Docker Hub hosts various Docker images.

Docker Compose
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure application services.

Creating Docker Compose File
A docker-compose.yml file is created to orchestrate the setup for PostgreSQL and PGAdmin. This file contains configuration for services, environment variables, ports, and volumes.

Building and Running Docker Compose
After creating the docker-compose.yml file, Docker is used to build and run the services. Steps include checking Docker status, running docker-compose up, and accessing PGAdmin through a web browser.

Configuring PostgreSQL Database Connection
PGAdmin is configured to connect to the PostgreSQL database using the container name, username, and password specified in the Docker Compose file.

Final Commands
Instructions are provided for stopping Docker Compose and removing data volumes to reset the database and configurations.

Conclusion
This README provides a step-by-step guide for managing the Apple Inc. database, covering entity identification, relationship definition, schema design, normalization, querying, and Docker setup for PostgreSQL and PGAdmin. The process ensures a robust, efficient, and scalable database solution.


## how to build and run the docker ## 

Prerequisites
Ensure Docker is installed on your system. You can download it from Docker's official website.
Basic understanding of Docker and Docker Compose is beneficial.

Step 1: Create a Docker Compose File
Create a New File: In a suitable directory on your computer, create a file named docker-compose.yml.

Add Configuration: Open the file in a text editor and input the following content:
yaml
Copy code
version: '3.8'
services:
  db:
    container_name: postgres_container
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: postgres_db
      POSTGRES_USER: admin
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secret
      PGDATA: /var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  pgadmin:
    container_name: pgadmin4_container
    image: dpage/pgadmin4:5.5
    restart: always
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: admin@admin.com
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: secret
      PGADMIN_LISTEN_PORT: 80
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - pgadmin-data:/var/lib/pgadmin

volumes:
  db-data:
  pgadmin-data:

Step 2: Running Docker Compose
Open Terminal or Command Prompt: Navigate to the directory where your docker-compose.yml file is located.
Start Docker: Ensure Docker is running on your machine. You can verify this by typing docker info in the terminal.

Run Docker Compose: Execute the command docker-compose up. This command will start downloading the necessary Docker images (if not already downloaded) and start the containers as specified in the docker-compose.yml file.

Step 3: Accessing PGAdmin
Open Web Browser: Once the containers are running, open a web browser.
Navigate to PGAdmin: Go to http://localhost:8080 or http://127.0.0.1:8080.
Login to PGAdmin: Use the credentials provided in the Docker Compose file. In this case:
Email: admin@admin.com
Password: secret

Step 4: Configure PostgreSQL Database in PGAdmin
Add New Server: In PGAdmin, choose “Add New Server”.
Server Configuration:
In the 'Name' field, enter any name for organization purposes.
Go to the 'Connection' tab.
In 'Host name/address', enter the name of your PostgreSQL container (here, postgres_container).
Username: admin
Password: secret
Save Configuration: Click 'Save' to establish the connection.

Step 5: Managing Docker Compose
To Stop the Containers: In the terminal, execute docker-compose down.
To Clean Data: If you wish to reset your database and configurations:
Check volumes with docker volume ls.
Delete the desired volumes using docker volume rm [VOLUME_NAME].

## Notes
The Docker Compose file provided sets up PostgreSQL and PGAdmin. PostgreSQL will be accessible on port 5432, and PGAdmin will be accessible through a web browser on port 8080.
Data is persisted through Docker volumes, ensuring data is not lost when the containers are stopped.

By following these steps, you will have a PostgreSQL database and PGAdmin running in Docker containers, easily accessible for database management and development tasks.
